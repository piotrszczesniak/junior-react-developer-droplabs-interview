I have created this project using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

edit: I have just added TypeScript. Adding types in progress...

I have used following npm packages:

- react-router-dom / for navigation between views without page reload
- react-hook-form / for handling form submissions, easy error handling, all with limited renders; this has been first time I used it;
- jest testing library / for testing sorting function

  and resources:

- Fake Store API
- Lorem ipsum
- Lorem picsum

When it comes to styling, I keep too minimum to obtain clean RWD --> I use SASS library, SASS modules and ClassNames.

Sorting function is located in /src/utilis/sortProducts.js, test for this function in /src/utilis/sortProducts.test.js

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

### `npm test`
