Hello DropLabs recruting team,ðŸ‘‹

I have created this project using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

As required in the task description, I have used following npm packages:

- react-router-dom / for navigation between views without page reload
- react-hook-form / for handling form submissions, easy error handling, all with limited renders; this has been first time I used it;
- jest testing library / for testing sorting function

  and resources:

- Fake Store API
- Lorem ipsum
- Lorem picsum

I solved all 5 tasks. When it comes to styling, I keep too minimum to obtain clean RWD --> I use SASS library, SASS modules and ClassNames.

Sorting function (task 5) is located in /src/utilis/sortProducts.js, test for this function in /src/utilis/sortProducts.test.js

I believe all the features are implemented the way to work as expected in the tasks description. I am aware there is room for improvement and refactoring.

I hope, the app works well enough to present my skills and problem solving attidute.

Thanks for allowing me to take part in your recruitment process, I enjoyed it and learnt quite a bit ðŸ™‚

Looking forward to hearing from you shortly,
Regards, Piotr.
