Hello DropLabs recruting team,

I have created this project using Create React App.

As suggest in the task description I have used following npm packages:

- react-router-dom / for navigation between views without page reload
- react-hook-form / for handling form submissions, easy error handling, all with limited renders; this has been first time I used it;
-

You may also see any lint errors in the console.
